Description
----------------
This is a WIP Editor for the Van Buren Tech Demo, part of a project called Project Presidents, this tool is written in C, which may very likely switch to C++ in the future. This program currently compiles using make with Ubuntu. Future versions will likely use the SDL library when I gain further understanding of it.

As of right now all it is a glorified Creature editor, and it can't even do that right, will hopefully finish some SPECIAL editing here soon.

As I am currently learning C and C++ there very well may be brute-force style coding issues, outdated standards, and some things may be flat out wrong. I will try to fix and edit these mistakes as I become aware of them. Also, anyone is free to take this code and modify it to their hearts content.

Overview
----------------
Repository structure:
- docs: Documentation files. Currently just contains a simple .txt file about creature body types.
- build: Shouldn't be in the repository itself but will be where compiled binaries will go.

Disclaimer
----------------
This program is as already stated, a Work-In-Progress, so .it can corrupt the files you are working on. Not all .CRT files are structured the same, mainly NPC vs PC .CRTs, where the NPC pulls name data from elsewhere(probably mission scripts), whereas PC defines it's own name.

Compiling & Contributing
----------------

Compiling this editor is easy, simply download a zip of this repo, then compile the PPIT.C using any C compiler or using the make file provided, as of now this program relies on no 3rd party libraries.

If you wish to contribute and assist, any help is welcome, right now the program is extremely WIP and many things change weekly, some stability in this project could definetly help. Right now though, I believe some organization is in order, I was never the most organized person.
