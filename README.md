# Van-Buren-Editor
This is a test repo to house code of an editor for the Van Buren Tech Demo, name liable to change

Now I understand this isn't exactly the proper way to do a README, or the most professional way but it's 8:55 in the morning and I stayed up all night browsing the internet for a 1948 Dodge 230 I6 6V Positive ground Generator core(long story).

This is a Concept WIP Editor for the Van Buren Tech Demo, written in C, perhaps C++ in the future. This program is being written in Dev-C++ as it is a very lightweight environment, this may change if required but not very likely. Future versions may use SDL if I can put 2 and 2 together and figure out why including libraries in a project hates me. As I am currently learning C there may be coding issues or outdated methods. I will fix these as I become aware of them. Anyone is free to take this code and modify it to their hearts content, not that there is much code to it.

God speed Gentlemen/Gentleladies, Regards RedneckHax0r and/or L33TMaster(I need to pick one, don't I?)
