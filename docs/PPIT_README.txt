Quick README for PPIT - Updated WED MAY 10 2019

Project Presidents Inauguration Tool - Readme

Quick Description
----------------

This is a WIP Editor for the Van Buren Tech Demo, part of a project called Project Presidents, which is an attempt to create an engine and toolset to handle said Demo assets. 

This program is in the style of the old command prompt editors back in the 90s, mainly because this is written in the same way, it perhaps will change as time goes on.

As of right now all it is a glorified creature editor, and it can't even do that right, so things will without a doubt break and it doesn't work as intended.

Quick Tutorials
----------------

Changing a .CRT's body type(Absolutely useless because Hum is the only body type)

1. Extract the PPIT.exe to the same location as the .CRT file.
2. Run the PPIT.exe file using command prompt.
3. Type "1" and press ENTER to access CRT editing
4. Enter the name of the file(including the extension) and press ENTER.
5. Then enter what to replace Hum with(can be anything, but only Hum works in game)

Remember this is still a giant WIP, nothing is really all that helpful right now.
