Project Presidents Inauguration Tool - Readme

Description
----------------

This is a WIP Editor for the Van Buren Tech Demo, part of a project called Project Presidents, which is an attempt to create an engine and toolset for said Demo assets. 

This program is in the style of the old command prompt editors back in the 90s, mainly because this is written in the same way, it will change as time goes on.

As of right now all it is a glorified body editor, and it can't even do that right, so things will break and won't work as intended.

Quick Tutorials
----------------

Changing a .CRT's body type

1. Extract the PPIT.exe to the same location as the .CRT file.
2. Run the PPIT.exe file using command prompt.
3. Type "1" and press ENTER to access CRT editing
4. Enter the name of the file(including the extension) and press ENTER.
5. Then enter what to replace Hum with(can be anything, but only Hum works in game)

Remember this is still a giant WIP, nothing is really all that helpful right now.
